# TCP-Congestion-Control

## Overview

The Transmission Control Protocol (TCP) is a fundamental protocol that provides reliable, ordered, and error-checked delivery of a stream of bytes between applications. It ensures that data is transmitted accurately and efficiently over the network.

Congestion control is a key feature of TCP designed to manage network traffic to prevent congestion, which can lead to packet loss, increased latency, and network collapse. It involves mechanisms that detect congestion in the network and adjust the transmission rate accordingly to maintain optimal performance.

In this project, I have created a simulation of TCP behavior to demonstrate how it handles congestion in the network. The simulation induces congestion in the channel and applies different algorithms to show how TCP detects and tackles congestion.
